### FIFAI

Soccer is regarded as one of the most unpredictable sports globally, so building a model to accurately predict the scorelines, or at least the end results of Premier League matches is a challenging, yet exciting task. 

There has been some success with predicting the results of soccer matches in the past using the Poisson distribution, but we aim to improve on this accuracy and take it a step further by predicting scorelines. 

We will try to use a more robust dataset with more datapoints along with a more optimized algorithm to improve upon previous results. 

Ideally, we would like to have an algorithm that can accurately predict the scoreline, and along with that the result of the game; we could even extend it by including the most likely goalscorers. 

We acknowledge that predicting the exact scoreline of a Premier League is a very difficult problem, but if we could predict at least the result with an accuracy of above 50%, it would be a success. 

If we are able to build a successful model, we realise that it might lead to an increase in the amount of bets made on Premier League matches, leading to those consequences faced by excessive gambling.
